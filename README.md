# adventure-blog-one-page-layout
This is a little project after first learning CSS grid, i wanted to do something to test my knowledge as well as to learn in a little more heavy way.

Adventure Travel Blog – Static Page
How to Run

-Clone or download the repository.
-Open the index.html file in your web browser.
-All styles and images are local, so no server setup is needed — just double-click or drag the file into a browser window.

Overview

This is my first static web page built entirely by myself. The project is a travel and adventure blog landing page designed to practice CSS Grid, Flexbox, and basic HTML elements.
Working on this page was a great learning experience, especially when dealing with layout and form elements.

Key Features
-Responsive Grid Layouts: Used CSS Grid and Flexbox to structure the page sections.
-Hero Section: Includes a large headline, subtext, and a background image.
-Destinations Section: Image gallery styled with grid and hover effects.
-Newsletter Signup Form: First time experimenting with the <input> and <label> elements.
-Footer: Multi-column grid layout with links, social icons, and a copyright notice.
Interactive Elements: Buttons with hover effects, icon usage via Font Awesome.

Lessons Learned

-Grid Layouts: Learned that the parent container must have display: grid; for the child positioning to work — a simple but crucial step I initially missed.

-Form Elements: First experience with <input> and <label> for newsletter signup, understanding accessibility and usability.

-Git Workflow: Still improving my submission process, but this project was a great step in getting hands-on experience.
